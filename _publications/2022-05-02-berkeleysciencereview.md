excerpt: 'Late in the night on April 26, 1986, Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant Unit 4 was scheduled for routine safety testing. Preparations for testing left the reactor in an unstable condition, resulting in a meltdown followed by explosions that destroyed the reactor building and released radioactive material for many days after.'

In May 2018, a team of scientists from Professor Kai Vetter’s group at the UC Berkeley Department of Nuclear Engineering and LBL visited Chornobyl and the surrounding areas with a gamma-ray imaging system to construct maps of the remaining contamination. Graduate student Jake Hecla, who visited the site, explained, “We went to Chornobyl because it was effectively a field test of our technology applied to its ultimate purpose. The whole point of this technology is to map and eventually quantify radiation environments for worker safety and a variety of other reasons.”
