I am a first year nuclear engineering PhD student at UC Berkeley interested in radiation detection for applications in nuclear safeguards, security, and nonproliferation. 

I love science outreach and developing programs to support underreprested groups in STEM.

In my free time I like hiking, tabletop games, and reading.
