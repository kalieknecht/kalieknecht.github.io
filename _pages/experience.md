* Assembled a pandas dataframe of data collected in preliminary data hunt.
* Visualized data using python tools.
* Presented research at end of summer poster session.

## Argonne National Laboratory
**Nuclear Science & Engineering Intern** | May 2018 - August 2018
* Developed code in Fortran to update SAS4A/SASSYS-1 input preprocessor to allow free format input.
* Extended unit testing capabilities of SAS4A/SASSYS-1.
* Discussed code changes at oral presentation.

## The University of Tennessee, Knoxville
**Nuclear Engineering Undergraduate Research Assistant** | January 2017 - May 2019
* Evaluated transition from an open to closed nuclear fuel cycle using Cyclus.
* Assembled input files of various fuel cycles written in XML.
* Interpreted data collected from Cyclus using Python.

**Materials Science & Engineering Undergraduate Research Assistant** | May 2015 - January 2017
* [End of Summer Poster](/files/MSE.pdf).
* Synthesized a sample for study using conventional solid-state synthesis.
* Conducted an in-situ high temperature x-ray diffraction (XRD) study and analyzed XRD patterns.

* Created and presented a poster with a summary of all work and results at The Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society national conference in 2016.

## Dominion Energy
**Nuclear Safety Analysis Intern** | May 2017 - August 2017
* Analyzed Time to Core Boil (TTCB) for various RCS conditions in GOTHIC thermal-hydraulic code resulting in more accurate TTCB estimates.
* Communicated with Surry personnel to present TTCB analysis and results in a way that would be most easily used by plant operators.
* Updated GOTHIC 8.0 to 8.2 and benchmarked important cases.
* Planned after-hour social events for interns to enjoy with a \$1000 budget provided by Dominion.

**Nuclear Spent Fuel Intern** | August 2016 - December 2016
* Created a database of Millstone Power Station spent fuel that allows engineers to extract data for dry storage more efficiently, reducing engineering work time by at least 50%.
* Evaluated source range lengths for earlier cask loading of non-fuel core components.
* Examined fuel anomalies in North Anna fuel assemblies to qualify them for dry storage.
* Compiled design inputs to allow construction of a new Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation pad at Surry.
* Identified issue with a group of assemblies that were intended to be loaded into a dry cask.

**Nuclear Core Design Intern** | January 2016 - May 2016
* Reported burnup, isotopic, and monthly core follow data and ensured plant was operating as expected.
* Investigated secondary source assemblies and determine=ed that they would need to be replaced earlier than previously thought.
* Reported the startup physics testing for Surry Unit 2.
* Used CASMO to model new Surry Power Station fuel assemblies.
* Analyzed control rod drop times during startup physics testing at North Anna Unit 2.
