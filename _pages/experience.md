* Generated 3D Compton Images from radiation data collected at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station and Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.
* Using scene data collected by a free-moving gamma-ray detector and auxilliary contextual sensor package to optimize measurement positions for quantitative gamma-ray imaging.
* Using 3D object detection and 3D semantic segmentation machine learning techniques to identify and label discrete objects in LiDAR point clouds.
* Developing genetic and other algorithmic approaches to identify optimal measurement positions for quantitative gamma-ray imaging.

## Los Alamos National Laboratory
**Space Science & Applications Intern** | May 2020 - August 2020
* Project title: **Multi-pixel CdTe detector for space environment measurements**
* Participated in the NSSC-LANL Keepin Summer Program - a seven week extended research internship that provides a survey of the national laboratory activities and mission space, focused research projects with a strong connection to nonproliferation science and technology, and a companion symposium series linking nuclear security science, technology, and policy.
* Developed software to analyze the charge collection in a two-pixel semiconductor detector to be used in a space radiation telescope.

## Dominion Energy
**Nuclear Safety Analysis Intern** | May 2017 - August 2017
* Analyzed Time to Core Boil (TTCB) for various RCS conditions in GOTHIC thermal-hydraulic code resulting in more accurate TTCB estimates.
* Communicated with Surry personnel to present TTCB analysis and results in a way that would be most easily used by plant operators.
* Updated GOTHIC 8.0 to 8.2 and benchmarked important cases.
* Planned after-hour social events for interns to enjoy with a \$1000 budget provided by Dominion.

**Nuclear Spent Fuel Intern** | August 2016 - December 2016
* Created a database of Millstone Power Station spent fuel that allows engineers to extract data for dry storage more efficiently, reducing engineering work time by at least 50%.
* Evaluated source range lengths for earlier cask loading of non-fuel core components.
* Examined fuel anomalies in North Anna fuel assemblies to qualify them for dry storage.
* Compiled design inputs to allow construction of a new Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation pad at Surry.
* Identified issue with a group of assemblies that were intended to be loaded into a dry cask.

**Nuclear Core Design Intern** | January 2016 - May 2016
* Reported burnup, isotopic, and monthly core follow data and ensured plant was operating as expected.
* Investigated secondary source assemblies and determine=ed that they would need to be replaced earlier than previously thought.
* Reported the startup physics testing for Surry Unit 2.
* Used CASMO to model new Surry Power Station fuel assemblies.
* Analyzed control rod drop times during startup physics testing at North Anna Unit 2.
